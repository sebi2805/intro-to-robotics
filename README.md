Each folder and file in the structure serves a specific purpose and is described next to it for quick reference.

## Homework #1 - Setting Up the Environment

### Deadline (hard): 20th of October, 23:59.

### Objective

The primary goal of this homework is to set up the development environment for the course. This involves installing the Arduino IDE, as we will be extensively working with it throughout the semester. Additionally, this homework requires the creation of a private GitHub repository that adheres to specific guidelines.

## Completed Homework #2: Controlling RGB LEDs with Potentiometers

### Deadline Met: 23rd October 2023

### [Showcase Video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/dX5UbsVYVTg)

#### Objectives Achieved

- Controlled each channel (Red, Green, Blue) of RGB LED using individual potentiometers.
- Gained hands-on experience interfacing potentiometers with Arduino.
- Dynamic control of RGB LEDs based on real-time analog readings.

#### Components Utilized

- **RGB LED**: 1
- **Potentiometers**: 4 (extra one for minimal signal value implementation)
- **Resistors and Wires**: 330Î© resistors and necessary wiring.

#### Technical Highlights

- Individual control of RGB LED colors using separate potentiometers.
- Utilization of Arduino's analog-to-digital conversion to read potentiometer values.
- Mapped potentiometer readings to appropriate PWM values for LED control.

#### Coding Standards

- Clean, well-structured code.
- Use of meaningful constants instead of "magic numbers."
- Implementation of filters like moving averages and minimal displayable values.

##### Best Practices and Common Mistakes Avoided

1. Utilized `map()` function for accurate mapping.
2. Calculations separated from `analogWrite()` function.
3. Used meaningful variable names.
4. Replaced "magic numbers" with well-named constants.
5. Ensured the correct number of components for the task.

#### Additional Measures: Hardware Filtering

- Capacitors added between the VCC and GND of potentiometers for hardware-level noise reduction.
