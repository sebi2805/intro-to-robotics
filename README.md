**Homework #1 - Setting Up the Environment (Deadline: 20th of October, 23:59)**

The primary goal of this homework is to set up the development environment for the course. This involves installing the Arduino IDE, as we will be extensively working with it throughout the semester. Additionally, this homework requires the creation of a private GitHub repository that adheres to specific guidelines.
